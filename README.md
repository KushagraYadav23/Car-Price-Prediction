CAR PRICE PREDICTION

This project aims to predict car prices based on various factors such as age, net worth, and annual salary. 
It leverages the knowledge of data analysis and machine learning techniques to build predictive models.

Objectives:

The main objective of this project are:-
* To implement data analysis and machine learning algorithms for car price prediction.
* To compare the performance of different regression models such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* To evaluate the models' performance using the R2 score and select the best performing model.
* To develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to input new data and test the model's prediction.

Mehodology:

* Data Collection: Gathered data on car prices, age, net worth, and annual salary.
* Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, handling missing values and outliers if any.
* Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and transformed data for better model performance.
* Model Training: Trained different regression models including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* Model Evaluation: : Evaluated the models' performance using the R2 score metric.
* Model Selection: : Selected the Linear Regression model as the best fit based on the evaluation results.
* GUI Development: Developed a user-friendly GUI to input new data and test the model's prediction.
